# NVIDIA Confidential Computing Expands, Enabling Frontier Model Builders to Securely Scale Across Global Infrastructure

NVIDIA Blog · John Fanelli · 2026-10-21

NVIDIA builds tools to enable safe agents across the stack. The NVIDIA OpenShell Reference Architecture, announced today, is part of NVIDIA’s growing portfolio of technologies that enables organizations to safely deploy agents at scale. NVIDIA Confidential Computing is the infrastructure layer that protects the models and data those agents depend on while running.
Today, NVIDIA is expanding that layer with Confidential Bare Metal, a new deployment option with NVIDIA Confidential Computing that enables frontier model builders to run sensitive workloads on dedicated third-party infrastructure while retaining control of their models and data.
NVIDIA is introducing new platform security controls that protect data in transit, measure platform integrity and enforce hardware-level access restrictions. These new controls let frontier model builders use bare-metal instances to own and operate their bespoke software stack, including host and platform infrastructure software, when operating on NVIDIA accelerated computing infrastructure across third-party cloud, neocloud and enterprise infrastructure.
NVIDIA Confidential Computing now offers a converged security architecture with three deployment options:
- Confidential Bare Metal for bare-metal infrastructure
- Confidential Containers for Kubernetes environments
- Confidential Virtual Machines for virtualized environments
Organizations can match the right model to their trust boundaries and operating requirements.
NVIDIA Confidential Computing is also expanding across NVIDIA Grace Blackwell and Rubin systems and will integrate with NVIDIA DSX OS as a reference architecture for cloud providers building AI factories.
Model Builders Tap Global Capacity
Confidential Bare Metal gives supported providers a path to serve high-value workloads that require strong model and data privacy protections. For model builders, the expanding ecosystem offers more geographic, sovereign and operational options for scaling training and inference worldwide.
Cohere plans to integrate Confidential Bare Metal into Cohere Model Vault, using NVIDIA Confidential Computing trusted execution environments to extend hardware-rooted security directly to the GPU — protecting models and data in memory and across interconnects during execution.
“Enterprises trust Cohere to provide a secure and confidential platform for inference,” said Phil Blunsom, chief technology officer at Cohere. “With NVIDIA Confidential Computing in Cohere Model Vault, we’re extending hardware-rooted security directly to the GPU, protecting customer data in memory and across interconnects during execution.”
Google Cloud is extending support for  Confidential Bare Metal to A4X Max instances powered by NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems. These will combine non-virtualized NVIDIA accelerated computing with cryptographic protection for training data and model intellectual property.
“Google Cloud introduces Confidential Bare Metal to provide AI labs with hardware-isolated, non-virtualized compute environments and end-to-end cryptographic protection. Our A4X instances, built using NVIDIA Confidential Computing, preserve the privacy of user data, protect model IP, provide top-line serving performance,” said Andrés Lagar-Cavilla, distinguished engineer and AI infrastructure security lead at Google Cloud.
Confidential Computing Expands Across the NVIDIA Platform
NVIDIA Confidential Computing uses hardware-rooted isolation and cryptographic attestation to help protect models and data during execution.
Support now extends to NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 — bringing Confidential Computing to NVL72 rack-scale systems — as well as x86-based NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 and NVIDIA DGX Rubin NVL8 systems.
CoreWeave, Firmus, GMI Cloud, Google Cloud, IREN, Lambda, Microsoft Azure Infrastructure, Nebius, Nscale and Vultr support NVIDIA Confidential Computing deployments. Global systems partners including Cisco, Dell Technologies, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro and Bull will support these capabilities with NVIDIA-Certified Systems.
NVIDIA DSX OS will support all NVIDIA Confidential Computing modes, giving cloud providers a software foundation for building and operating AI factories that support confidential workloads.
